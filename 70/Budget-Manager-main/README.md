   cd budget-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Usage

To start the application, you have two options depending on whether you want to use Redis or just the JSON server:

### Local Development (with JSON Server)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Local Development (with Redis)

```bash
npm run dev-redis
```

This will start the Next.js development server and the JSON server for mock API responses.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
